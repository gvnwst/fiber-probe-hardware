# Magnetic clamping fiber holders for Luer-Lock needles

A weakness of the Luer-Lock needles is that the fibers are difficult to hold.
A trimmed rubber grommet works, but it's difficult. Inspired by the magnetic fiber clamps on our fusion splicer (and cleaver, etc, magnetic portion similar to [these](https://www.ozoptics.com/news/pr_173.html)), here's a piece of hardware which clamps onto the steel Luer lock needles and magnetically clamps your fibers into place. Easy-peasy fiber length adjustment.
It should also allow rotational adjustment for PM fiber, just loosen one of the collar screws and turn the whole chuck. More permanent clamping of the fiber may require adjustments.

The rubber sheet will need to be cut into a strip about 0.2" wide and just under 0.5" wide, then glued into the appropriately-sized slot on the clamp flange.
This will provide a friction surface to hold the fiber into the groove.

BOM is *per fiber clamp*. You'll want two (at least) for each probe station, input and output fibers.
Of course, some items have a large quantity and do not need multiples ordered when constructing more than one fiber clamp.

The base and collar are designed for ~perfect fitting around the Luer-Lock needle necks.
You may find that it's a bit loose. To solve this, simply take the collar and rub it (the face which contacts the base) against some medium-grit sandpaper until a few thousandths are taken off, so
Re-check fit, keep going if necessary -- you can take off a lot, needbe.
