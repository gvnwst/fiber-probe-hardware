# Tweezer Rack Version 1

This design is a rack which holds tweezers, particularly the types and sizes used to manipulate small chips up to 150 mm wafers. 
It is intended to be rigidly affixed to a table or surface via the pair of holes on the bottom flange (or adhesive tape, if no appropriate surface for threading into/drilling through is available). 
Flush-head studs are screwed into the threaded holes from the back side of the main flange. 
Tweezers are hung off this, akin to a coat rack. 
Alternately, tweezers may be inserted into the top rectangular slots, handle-first. 
The round holes on each side hold many standard size pens or sharpies.

It is stable with tweezers hung on the primary surface, but may be tippy if only the top slots are loaded.

The design is a replica of the tweezer stands used in MIT's cleanroom facilities (MIT Nano), the designs for which were kindly provided by Jorg Scholvin.
Jorg had these manufactured at [send-cut-send](https://sendcutsend.com/). They provide anodized finishes and can mount flush studs (0.5 inch) into the threaded holes.

A ready-to-manufacture `DXF` of the flattened part is included in the design directory.
